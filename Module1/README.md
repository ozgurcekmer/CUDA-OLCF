# HW 1
- A ***Hello World*** program
- ***Extra:*** Added an OpenMP solver

# HW 2
- Vector addition
- 2 solvers:
    - CPU - Serial
    - GPU
- A Performance analysis 

# HW 3
- Matrix multiply
- 2D threadblock/grid indexing
- 3 solvers:
    - CPU - Serial
    - CPU - Blas
    - GPU - Naive
- Performance results of the solvers are given in the next chapter with the additional solvers 

## ***NOTE:***
- The emphasis in this problem set was on the correctness of the GPU usage (kernel development). Hence, the performance results will be analysed in the following modules.
- All codes have been tested on a personal laptop with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 with Max-Q Design GPU
