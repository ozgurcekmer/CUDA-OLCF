# OO Solutions of the CUDA-OLCF Training Series HWs
- This repo was created to propose object-oriented (OO) homework solutions for CUDA training series provided by NVIDIA to OLCF and NERSC ([NVIDIA CUDA series archive](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/cuda-training-series/)). The original homework repo by NVIDIA is public [here](https://github.com/olcf/cuda-training-series).
- Just to make it clear: ***I do NOT represent NVIDIA***.
- This personal repo ***is NOT officially endorsed by NVIDIA***.
- Some of the codes have been prepared to be generic to work on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
